            One of the last times I saw him, after I had finished writing most
            of the book, I asked him again about his tendency to be rough on
            people. “Look at the results,” he replied. “These are all smart
            people I work with, and any of them could get a top job at another
            place if they were truly feeling brutalized. But they don’t.” Then
            he paused for a few moments and said, almost wistfully, “And we got
            some amazing things done.” Indeed, he and Apple had had a string of
            hits over the past dozen years that was greater than that of any
            other innovative company in modern times: iMac, iPod, iPod nano,
            iTunes Store, Apple Stores, MacBook, iPhone, iPad, App Store, OS X
            Lion—not to mention every Pixar film. And as he battled his final
            illness, Jobs was surrounded by an intensely loyal cadre of
            colleagues who had been inspired by him for years and a very loving
            wife, sister, and four children.
